# Back-end with Node.js and Typescript basics

This template was created in order to skip the basic configurations I use for the most part of my projects. <br/><br/>
It comes with some common dependencies, such as express, typescript, some code style enforcers, such as ESLint and Prettier, following AirBnB lines, and Yarn as package manager.<br/><br/>
To link dependencies, run
`yarn` command locally in your terminal.<br/><br/>
To start its execution, run the command `yarn dev:server` and it will execute through port 3333. To use another port it, change its value in the file `src/server.ts`.
